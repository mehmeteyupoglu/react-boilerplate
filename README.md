# Project Name

Initial project description

## Principles, Docs and Methodologies

From the very beginning of the project, a clean architecture, well-decomposed code on the client side has been the ultimate objective. Especially reactivity and the reusability of the framework has been exploited to have a light and performant web app.

### Tools, conventions, design systems

- [Conventional commits](www.conventionalcommits.org/) have been used throught the development process for a clean and consistent versioning
- The project has been documented with the help of [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/)
- To have a clean reusability of components and a solid reusable structure, [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles helped
